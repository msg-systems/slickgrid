## This is the 6pac SlickGrid repo

This is the acknowledged most active non-customised fork of SlickGrid.

It aims to be a viable alternative master repo, building on the legacy of the mleibman/SlickGrid master branch, keeping libraries up to date and applying small, safe core patches and enhancements without turning into a personalised build.

Check out the [examples](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid/wiki/Examples) for examples demonstrating new features and use cases, such as dynamic grid creation and editors with third party controls.

Here is the documentation of the extension of SlickGrid by the [grid option](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki/Grid-Options) for dynamic row height (`dynRowHeight`).
As background for this extension we used the second answer of the question ['Is variable rowheight a possibility in SlickGrid?'](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2805094/is-variable-rowheight-a-possibility-in-slickgrid) from the stackoverflow thread. 

Also check out the [wiki](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid/wiki) for news and documentation.
